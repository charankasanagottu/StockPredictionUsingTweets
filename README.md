Overview
Stock market movements are heavily influenced by public sentiment. This project aims to extract sentiment from tweets using sentiment analysis models and correlate it with stock price trends to predict future stock prices. The model uses a combination of Twitter data, historical stock data, and machine learning techniques.
Features
•	Sentiment analysis on Twitter data using NLP techniques.
•	Integration with stock price data to predict stock movements.
•	Visualizations of stock price trends and sentiment.
•	Historical analysis of stock price and sentiment correlation.
Tech Stack
•	Python: Core programming language.
•	TensorFlow: For deep learning model training.
•	Keras: High-level neural networks API for building models.
•	NLTK & TextBlob: Natural language processing tools for sentiment analysis.
•	Yahoo Finance API: To fetch historical stock price data.
•	Twitter API: To collect real-time tweets related to the stock market.
•	Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Data Collection
•	Tweets Data: Collected using the Twitter API, filtered by specific stock-related hashtags and keywords.
•	Stock Prices: Fetched using Yahoo Finance API for corresponding stock tickers.
•	Preprocessing:
o	Remove irrelevant tweets.
o	Perform tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization on tweets.
o	Merge stock price data with sentiment scores.
Model Architecture
The project implements a deep learning model to predict stock prices based on sentiment analysis. It includes the following steps:
1.	Sentiment Analysis: Classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral using NLP models.
2.	Price Prediction Model: Feed the historical stock data and sentiment scores into a time-series model like LSTM to predict stock movements.
Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:
1.	Clone the repository: ```bash git clone https://github.com/charankasanagottu/StockPredictionUsingTweets.git cd StockPredictionUsingTweets

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Twitter API credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Twitter API keys and tokens:
     ```
     TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
     TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
     TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
     TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
     ```

4. Set up Yahoo Finance API:
   - No additional setup is required for the Yahoo Finance API.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Run the script to fetch tweets and stock prices:
     ```bash
     python fetch_data.py
     ```

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Train the model using historical stock and sentiment data:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

3. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict future stock prices:
     ```bash
     python predict.py
     ```

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the stock price trends and sentiment over time:
     ```bash
     python visualize.py
     ```

## Results

- The project demonstrates the correlation between public sentiment and stock price fluctuations.
- The prediction accuracy improves over time with more data.
- Sample visualizations and prediction results can be found in the `results/` folder.
